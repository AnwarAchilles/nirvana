Codeigniter 3 Modified

In the ever-fast-moving world of web development, CodeIgniter 3 may look like a relic that has been forgotten by most. However, this is what makes the Nirvana project even more interesting. We chose CodeIgniter 3 as our foundation, not because it is the latest, but because we have a strong determination to resurrect it, like a Phoenix emerging from the ashes.
